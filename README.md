# Plant Disease Classifier Frontend

Welcome to the Plant Disease Classifier Frontend repository! This repository contains the frontend code for the Plant Disease Classifier project. It is built entirely in ReactJS and deployed using Netlify.

## Project Overview

The Plant Disease Classifier Frontend is a web application developed to identify plant diseases swiftly and accurately. Utilizing ReactJS for the frontend, this project offers a user-friendly interface for uploading plant images and receiving disease classification results.

## Key Components

### 1. ReactJS Web Interface

The repository includes the ReactJS-based web interface, providing users with an intuitive platform to upload images of plants. The interface seamlessly integrates with the backend classifier (not included) to process uploaded images and display disease classification results.

### 2. Deployment

Experience the Plant Disease Classifier in action! The web interface is deployed and accessible online at [Plant Disease Classifier](https://plant-disease.netlify.app/). You can visit the provided URL to utilize the classifier immediately without any local setup.

### 3.Website Images
Check out some screenshots of our web interface:

## Getting Started

1. Visit the deployed web interface at [Plant Disease Classifier](https://plant-disease.netlify.app/).
2. Upload an image of a plant using the user-friendly interface.
3. Wait for the classifier to process the image.
4. Explore the classification results to gain insights into the health of the uploaded plant.

## Usage

The Plant Disease Classifier Frontend is designed to be simple and intuitive. Users can upload images of plants through the web interface and receive immediate disease classification results. Here's how to use it:

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the "Upload" button to select an image of a plant from your device.
2. **View Results**: Once the image is uploaded, the classifier will process it, and the results will be displayed on the screen.
3. **Explore Insights**: Gain valuable insights into the health of the plant based on the disease classification provided by the classifier.
